### To do
 - [ ] Make a base object `M_QWidget` that has all of the built-in stuff I want
    - [ ] Logging
    - [ ] Basic signals & slots
    - [ ] Clean exit
    - [ ] Mqtt
    - [ ] Status bar printing
- [ ] Adapt all the current widgets in `custom_qt_widgets.py` to be `MW_QWidget`'s
- [ ] Build a basic `M_QMqtt` object that has all of the basic functionality I want
	- [ ] replace the current class in `custom_qt_mqtt.py` with class that are defined within the class that they are used. They would extend the `M_QMqtt` base class.
- [ ] Finish building the widgets for the tabs for a basic MVP
	- [ ] Needs to start/stop the data capture
	- [ ] Needs to store the raw data in a tdms file
	- [ ] Needs to plot the data in real-time on the app
	- [ ] Needs to be able to recall and plot the raw-data
